# CV

This repository generates the CV (Curriculum Vitae) present in https://cv.telmoapmiranda.net.

The CV contents are declared in the [`cv.yaml`](./cv.yaml) file.
[jsonresume](https://jsonresume.org/) is used to generate the CV HTML from the [`cv.yaml`](./cv.yaml).
Static assets to be added to the generated HTML should be placed in the ´github-pages´ folder.
[Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) is used to serve the CV HTML from the ´github-pages´ branch on https://telmoapmiranda.github.io/cv.
The [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) is configured to use https://cv.telmoapmiranda.net as a [custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages).

## Getting started

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using the [development container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) is the recommended IDE.
Using the extension [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)




From within the [container](./Dockerfile) the following commands can be run:

-   Display available commands:

    ```sh
    make help
    ```

-   Generate the CV in HTML format:

    ```sh
    make generate-html
    ```

    The CV contents are read from [`cv.yaml`](./cv.yaml) and generated to [`generated/index.html`](./generated/index.html).

-   Spell check the HTML generated CV:

    ```sh
    make spell-check
    ```

    The CV HTML file will be generated by this command.
    Spell check errors MUST be fixed in the [`cv.yaml`](./cv.yaml) file or an exclude entry added in the [`spell-check-exclude.dic`](./spell-check-exclude.dic) dictionary file.

-   Format the [`spell-check-exclude.dic`](./spell-check-exclude.dic) dictionary file used to exclude spell checker errors:

    ```sh
    make format-spell-check-exclude-file
    ```

    This will sort and remove duplicate lines from the file.

## Spell check

[Hunspell](http://hunspell.github.io/) is used to spell check the HTML generated CV.

[Hunspell](http://hunspell.github.io/) is very sensitive to the HTML formatting, particularly to HTML empty tags without the closing `/`.
If the HTML file is not complaint with the XHTML format, [Hunspell](http://hunspell.github.io/) will not properly parse the file.
To fix this, the CV HTML file is formatted to XHTML with [tidy](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tidy) before being parsed by [Hunspell](http://hunspell.github.io/) to spell check its contents.

The [`spell-check-exclude.dic`](./spell-check-exclude.dic) dictionary file is used to exclude spell checker errors.
If [Hunspell](http://hunspell.github.io/) is reporting false spelling errors, add the words to this file to fix the errors.
The file uses the format defined [here](https://man.archlinux.org/man/hunspell.5.en).

## Continuous delivery

Every push to ´master´ will trigger the [CD github workflow](.github/workflows/cd.yaml) to:

-   Generate the CV in HTML format.
-   Copy the generated assets to the ´github-pages´ folder.
-   Push the contents of the ´github-pages´ folder to the ´github-pages´ branch root.

The ´github-pages´ branch uses [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to expose the branch's content in https://telmoapmiranda.github.io/cv.
The content is also available in https://cv.telmoapmiranda.net as a [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) custom domain.

Any additional static assets that should be exposed together with the CV should be placed in the ´github-pages´ folder.
